BUILDING

The code includes CMake files for building on Linux.  We haven't built
or tested the code on any other platforms.

Out-of-source builds are recommended with CMake:

> mkdir wiberg-build  // Make wiberg-build a sibling directory to wiberg.
> cd wiberg-build 
> cmake ../wiberg
> make

If the build succeeds, wiberg-build will contain the libraries and executables,
while the wiberg directory will remain unchanged.


TEST PROGRAMS

There are currently two simple test programs:

  l1/factorization/factor_wiberg_test
  l1/factorization/factor_simultaneous_test

These execute ten iterations of L1 matrix factorization using Wiberg and
successive linear programming respectively.  Outputs look like:

$ ./factor_wiberg_test 
Initial residual: 28.3822
On iteration 0, accepting step from residual 28.3822 to 3.57098; mu goes to 100
On iteration 1, accepting step from residual 3.57098 to 0.0200214; mu goes to 1000
On iteration 2, accepting step from residual 0.0200214 to 9.4413e-07; mu goes to 10000
On iteration 3, accepting step from residual 9.4413e-07 to 7.15641e-07; mu goes to 100000

On iteration 6, rejecting step from residual 7.15641e-07 to 7.15641e-07; mu goes to 100
On iteration 7, rejecting step from residual 7.15641e-07 to 7.15641e-07; mu goes to 10
On iteration 8, rejecting step from residual 7.15641e-07 to 7.15641e-07; mu goes to 1

On iteration 9, rejecting step from residual 3.15725e-06 to 3.19512e-06; mu goes to 0.001


DEPENDENCIES

The code relies on Eigen for matrix operations and Coin LP for linear
programming.  You may have to tweak wiberg/CMakeLists.txt to make
CMake find the Eigen and Coin LP headers and libraries on your machine.

Our code relies on sparse matrices in Eigen, and Eigen's support for
sparse matrices is recent, so you may have to install and point to a
recent version to compile successfully.
